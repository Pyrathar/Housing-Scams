Good day and thanks for the response. the apartment is still free and
you can start to rent as soon as possible but sorry viewing the flat
will not be possible for now because i have left the country already
and i have the flat keys here with me, I just relocated here in
England due to my new job and that is the main reason I am renting out
the flat but I can only send you some of the flat pictures to see and
have an idea  of the flat. I will be waiting to hear from you soon.
Where are you now and what date do you intend to start renting and
move into the flat?
